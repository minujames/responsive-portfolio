# Responsive Portfolio
This is a project for showcasing the basic portfolio. It includes three pages 'About Me', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact Me'. A gallery of projects are showcased in the portfolio page, clicking them will lead to the atual project location. 

A responsive layout is achived by using media queries. Three breakpoints: 980px, 768px and 640px are used to change the layout of the pages as the device or viewport size changes.
